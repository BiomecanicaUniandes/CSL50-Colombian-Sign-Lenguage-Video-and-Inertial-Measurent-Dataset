# LSC50-Colombian-Sign-Lenguage-Video-and-Inertial-Measurent-Dataset

We provide scripts to load and read our database made up of videos and excel files,the .mot or .sto files must be read using OpenSim. The script was coded using Python 3.7.9. All scripts were tested on Windows. The repository README file contains detailed instructions to facilitate the use of the repository and brief descriptions of all files. The code is publicly available under the MIT OpenSource license. Therefore, permission is granted free of charge to copy and use this software and its associated files.

The LSC50: Colombian Sign Language Video Dataset database explores the specific case of the recognition of 50 signs defined in the Colombian sign language. The database has 4000 videos distributed in RGB, depth, and ir. Additionally, it has inertial measurement information involved in the movement of each of the signs. Moreover, finally, landmark files associated with the RGB videos were obtained. The total information in the database is equally distributed in the number of classes (50 signs) and the number of participants involved (5 volunteers: 3 native speakers and two non-native speakers).
